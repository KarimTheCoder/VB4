        <item> "A subpoena is a written order that commands someone to appear in court to give evidence as a witness. For example, Will they arrest my sister if she ignores the court's subpoena and does not take the witness stand?"  </item>
        <item> "To subside is to become less strong or intense. For example, after I took the medicine, the pain in my leg subsided."  </item>
        <item> "When you substantiate a claim or story, you supply evidence which proves that it is true. For example, since Jason did not take a picture of the spaceship, he cannot substantiate his claim of a UFO sighting."  </item>
        <item> "When something is superseded, it is replaced by something new. For example, in time, the features of the smartphone may supersede those of the personal computer."  </item>
        <item> "A supposition is an idea or theory that you believe is true, although you don't have any proof for it. For example, without any evidence, the teacher’s supposition Amy had cheated on the exam could not be proven."  </item>
        <item> "When something is tacit, it is expressed or understood without being directly stated. For example, even though my boyfriend and I have only been dating for three months, we have a tacit understanding to not date other people."  </item>

        <item> "When you describe something as tenuous, you say that it is not certain, definite, or strong. For example, since we are separated in age by eight years and have few common interests, my sister and I only share a tenuous bond of friendship."  </item>

        <item> "When something such as a person, problem, or device is tractable, they can be easily managed or controlled. For example, because the substitute teacher had a lot of classroom experience, she found it easy to turn the chaotic scene into a room of tractable students."  </item>
        <item> "A transgression is the violation of a duty, law, or moral principle. For example, although Jason was only twelve he was old enough to understand the transgression of stealing a car."  </item>
        <item> "Truculence is showing a dangerous kind of aggressiveness. For example, the aggressive man’s truculence caused him to be arrested and jailed for disorderly conduct."  </item>

        <item> "When something is viable, it has the capability to grow or function. For example, today global communication is viable without a telephone because of the Internet’s social applications."  </item>
        <item> "Something viscous is very thick, sticky and syrupy. For example, because honey is a viscous substance, it takes a great deal of work to remove it from a jar."  </item>
        <item> "Use vituperative to describe an angry criticism that is full of hate and insults. For example, we cannot be friends if you continue to attack me with vituperative words."  </item>
        <item> "When a situation or something is volatile, it is likely to erupt in violence suddenly and unexpectedly. For example, Because John and Frank have a volatile relationship, they often argue."  </item>
        <item> "If you are wary of something or someone, you don't quite trust them and want to proceed with caution. For example, one of the most important lessons that parents must teach young children is to always be wary of strangers."  </item>
